# Definitions for Individuals

The data model for individuals is defined by the various attributes that get mapped when contact data is [synced from DXP](../../connecting-data-sources/syncing-contact-data-from-dxp.md) or other data sources such as [Salesforce](../../connecting-data-sources/adding-a-salesforce-data-source.md) or [CSV](../../connecting-data-sources/adding-a-csv-data-source.md).

To view a list of these attributes, navigate to *Settings* &rarr; *Workspace Data* &rarr; *Definitions* &rarr; *Individuals*.
