# Managing Users

If you are the project Owner or have been assigned the Admin permission, you can invite and manage users. Here’s how to bring up the User Management page:

1. Click on Settings in the navigation panel. The default Settings page appears.

1. Click on User Management in the navigation area. The User Management page appears, listing all the project’s users.

From the User Management page, an Admin user (or Owner) can invite users, edit their permissions, and delete them.

If your project is new, you’ll want to invite your teammates to the project.

## Inviting Users

You can set the user’s permissions when their invitation acceptance is pending.
