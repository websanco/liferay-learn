Custom code updates to 7.3 are done the same way as updates to 7.2. The [Liferay Upgrade Planner](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner) is still the recommended way to upgrade custom development. It identifies your code that's affected by [7.3 Breaking Changes](../../liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md) and offers to automatically adapt your code to many of the changes.

Upgrade your custom development now using the [Liferay Upgrade Planner](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner) and see [Upgrading Code to Liferay 7.2](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029316391-Introduction-to-Upgrading-Code-to-Liferay-DXP-7-2) for more information.
