# Creating Your First Site

Sites are collections of pages that contain and display content. This article walks through creating a new Site based on an existing out-of-the-box template.

## Creating a Site

To create a new Community Site, follow these steps:

1. Open the _Global Menu_ and navigate to the _Control Panel_ and select _Sites_.

    ![Select Sites from the Control Panel.](./creating-your-first-site/images/01.png)

1. Click the Add icon (![Add Icon](../images/icon-add.png)) at the top right of the page.

1. Select the _Community Site_ Template. The Site Template you choose determines what default pages and applications the new Site is populated with.

1. Enter a name for the Site.

1. Click _Save_.

A new Site is created and ready for use with two pages: _Home_ and _Wiki_. Each page has several applications already deployed that you may begin exploring.

Users are presented a variety of Site Settings options to further configure their new Site. Click to learn more about [Site Settings](../site-building/site_settings.html).

## Viewing the Site

To view a newly created Site:

1. Verify that the Site selector shows the name of the _Community Site_ you created. Otherwise, click on the compass icon (![compass icon](../images/icon-compass.png)) to select the new Site.

    ![The Site selector in the Site Menu should display the new Site's name](./creating-your-first-site/images/03.png)

1. Click _Home_ beneath the Site selector.

You are taken to the Site's _Home_ page.
