# Fragment Style Reference

This reference documents all the Fragment Styles available. To access the Styles menu, navigate to the _Site Administration_ menu &rarr; _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_. Click _Edit_ next to the desired page and then the _Selection_ (![Selection icon](../../../images/icon-page-tree.png)) icon.

## Container Width

If you use a [Container Fragment](./using-page-fragments.md#layout-elements), you can configure the Container Width to determine whether the Container Fragment's width is static, especially if the browser window changes size.

![You can configure the container to be either Fluid or Fixed Width.](./fragment-styles-reference/images/01.png)

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Fluid | The Container's width changes if the browser window is resized; you can configure the Left and Right Margins (see below). |
| Fixed Width | The Left and Right Margins are of a fixed size. |

```tip::
   Many of the styles correspond to CSS classes. If you know CSS, many of the following fields will be familiar.
```

Many of the following styles have defined tokens; see [Creating a Style Book](../../site-appearance/style-books/using-a-style-book-to-standardize-site-appearance.md) and [Style Book Token Definitions](../../site-appearance/style-books/developer-guide/style-book-token-definitions.md) for more information.
