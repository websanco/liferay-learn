# Using Fragment Comments

As you and your team use Fragments to create new pages, you can use the Fragment Comments tool for collaboration. Fragment Comments are enabled out-of-the-box in Liferay DXP 7.3, but they are disabled by default in Liferay DXP 7.2. See [enabling Fragment Comments](#enabling-fragment-comments) to learn more.

1. Navigate to the Asset that contains the fragment where you want to add a comment.

1. Click the *Edit* icon (![Click on the Edit icon at the top.](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) at the top of the page.

## Enabling Fragment Comments

To enable comments for Fragments, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Content and Data* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Select *Content Page Editor* under the Virtual Instance Scope. Check the *Comments Enabled* checkbox and click the *Save* button.

   ![Navigate to the Content Page Editor and check the Comments Enabled checkbox.](using-fragment-comments/images/01.png)

   You should now be able to use Fragment Comments.

   Note that this affects content page comments for all instances. To control this on an instance-by-instance basis, navigate to the same setting in *Instance Settings* (instead of *System Settings*).
