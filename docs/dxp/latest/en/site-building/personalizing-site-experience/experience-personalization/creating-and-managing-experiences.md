# Creating and Managing Experiences

> Some Experiences functionality is available in Liferay 7.4+, 7.3 Fix Pack 1+, and 7.2 Fix Pack 11+ only.

You can customize your Content Page to different groups of users using *Experiences*. To learn about Liferay DXP Experiences, see [Content Page Personalization](./content-page-personalization.md).

## Creating a New Content Page Experience

1. Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2. On the Content Page you want to edit, click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) menu and select *Edit*, or [create a new Content Page](../../creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md).

3. At the top of the page, click on *Default* Experience to open the Experience selection dialog.

4. Click *New Experience*.

    ![Click on Experience to select your experience or click New Experience to create a new one.](./creating-and-managing-experiences/images/01.png)

5. Enter a name for the Experience and select the Segment for the audience you want to target, or [create a New Segment](../segmentation/creating-and-managing-user-segments.md).

    ```note::
       By default, new Experiences are assigned to the *Anyone* Segment and targeted to all website visitors.
    ```

1. On the *New Experience* dialog, under the Languages section, select [additional languages](./content-page-personalization.md#managing-experience-localization) you want to target with the Experience. For example, if your default Content Page language is en-US and you want to provide personalization for es-ES speakers, select this language as well. See [Managing Experience Localization](./content-page-personalization.md#managing-experience-localization) for more information.

    ![Select an existing Segment for the Experience and, opitonally, an additional language](./creating-and-managing-experiences/images/02.png)

6. Edit your Content Page with the information and layout you want to show to the selected Segment.

7. Using the Up (![Up](../../../images/icon-angle-up.png)) and Down (![Down](../../../images/icon-angle-down.png)) controls, move the Experience in the list to set its precedence (see [Understanding How Experiences Work](./content-page-personalization.md#understanding-how-experiences-work) for more information).

8. Click *Publish*.

After setting the Experience precedence, Members of the target Segment see the Page version customized for that Segment. All other users see the *Default* version.

## Managing Content Page Experiences

When you edit a Content Page, you can click on the *Experience* selector to manage the options for that page.

![You can add, edit, delete, or change priority for Experiences.](./creating-and-managing-experiences/images/04.png)

1. Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2. On the Content Page you want to edit, click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) menu and select *Edit*.

3. Click on the Experience you want to manage. From here you can

   - Set the Experience Priority, using the Up (![Up](../../../images/icon-angle-up.png)) and Down (![Down](../../../images/icon-angle-down.png)) controls.

   - Edit (![Edit](../../../images/icon-edit.png)) the Experience's name, selected Segment or Language.

   - Duplicate (![Duplicate](../../../images/icon-copy.png)) the Experience.

   - Delete (![Delete](../../../images/icon-delete.png)) the Experience.

    ```important::
       The order of your Experiences in the Experience selector determines the Experience precedence. See *Understanding How Experiences Work* in `Content Page Personalization <./content-page-personalization.md>`__ for more information.
