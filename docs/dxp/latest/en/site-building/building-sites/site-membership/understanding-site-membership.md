# Understanding Site Membership

Being a member of a Site grants you access and abilities beyond a typical Guest. These key benefits come with Site membership:

* Site members have more permissions than guests for many widgets like Message Boards and Wikis that enable them to create content and collaborate on your Site.
* Site members can be associated with Roles that grant Site privileges.

Site Roles are created at a global level, but when they're assigned they only provide permissions for the specific Site where they were assigned. Since Roles are created at a global level, they can't be created by Site Administrators (since Site Administrators only have Administrator privileges for their Site). *Teams*, however, let Site Administrators assign permissions to groups of Users within their Sites. See [Creating Teams](./creating-teams-for-sites.md) for more information.
