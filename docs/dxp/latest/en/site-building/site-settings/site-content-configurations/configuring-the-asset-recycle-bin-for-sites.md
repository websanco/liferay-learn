# Configuring the Asset Recycle Bin for Sites

The Recycle Bin stores content and assets that have been flagged for deletion, before they are permanently removed from the system. This functionality can be enabled globally by default and can be configured on a per-site basis. See the [Recycle Bin](../../../content-authoring-and-management/recycle-bin/recycle-bin-overview.md) section for more information on the Recycle Bin.

## Configuring the Recycle Bin for Sites

To enable or disable the Recycle Bin for a particular site, follow these steps:

1. Open the Product Menu and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Settings* (previously *Site Settings*).
1. Select the *Advanced* tab and scroll down to the *Recycle Bin* sub-heading and expand it.
1. Toggle the *Enable Recycle Bin* option from *YES* to *NO* to enable/disable the Recycle Bin for the Site.
1. Optionally provide a value (in minutes) in the *Trash Entries Max Age* input to specify how long the recycled assets should remain in the Recycle Bin before they are permanently deleted.
