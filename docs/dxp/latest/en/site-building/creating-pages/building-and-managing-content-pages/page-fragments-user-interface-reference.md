## Adding Fragments

1. While editing a Content Page, open the *Fragment and Widgets* (![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-cards2.png)) panel in the editing Sidebar Menu.

1. Drag and drop a Fragment to the desired location in your page layout.

Once added, you can change its placement at any time. You can also view its placement in your page's structure as well as access its configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the editing Sidebar Menu.

## Configuring Fragments

Liferay DXP provides options for configuring individual Fragments as well as their sub-elements. These options can vary, though some are common to all. You can view available configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the Sidebar Menu. Click on a Fragment or element and select which options you'd like to configure from the available tabs.

### General

Here you can configure Fragment specific options (e.g., heading level, video URL, button type).

### Styles

Here you can configure standard Fragment options (e.g., dimensions, background, borders), as well as Fragment specific options on occasion. With DXP's Responsive Layout Editor, you can also configure these settings for different devices. See [Configuring Fragment Styles](../../displaying-content/using-fragments/configuring-fragment-styles.md) and [Fragment Styles Reference](../../displaying-content/using-fragments/fragment-styles-reference.md) for more information.

### Image Source

Here you can select an element's image, view its resolution, and provide its alt text.

### Link

Here you can either manually add a URL to a page element, or select from an available content field. You can also specify the desired target (e.g., self, parent).

### Mapping

Here you can map page elements to available assets by selecting the desired item (e.g., web content article, document, blog) and specifying which of its fields to display in the element (e.g., title, author, name).

## Layout Elements

> Available: Liferay Portal CE 7.3 GA2+; previously called Layouts with *panels* and *rows*.

*Layout Elements* define drop zones and can be used to create the desired page structure. DXP's default layout Fragments include *Containers* and *Grids*. Once configured, you can drag and drop widgets or other Fragments into the defined areas, including additional containers or grids to create even more complex structures.

![Use Layout Elements to define drop zones and page structure.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/02.png)

### Container

Use *container* Fragments to add drop zones to a Content Page. In addition to standard style options, this field can be configured to maintain a fixed width or to adapt to fill the width of its page section. You can also set a container's Link field to add either internal or external links. Once published, clicking on the name of the fragment redirects users to your specified destination.

### Grid

Use *grid* Fragments to add multiple drop zone modules to a Content Page. These modules can be arranged into rows and columns. In addition to standard style options, you can determine the number of modules for each grid, the number of modules per row, and the vertical alignment of each module's content. You can also manually [adjust the width](./configuring-elements-on-content-pages.md#configuring-the-grid-fragment) of each module.

## Basic Components

These are simple design elements that add basic functionality to a page. Examples include buttons, headings, and tabs. With these Components, you can build your page piece by piece. DXP includes the following Basic Components.

### Button

Use *button* Fragments to add link elements to a Content Page. As part of configuration, choose from one of four available button styles.

### Image

Use *image* Fragments to add a configurable `image-square` element to a Content Page. As part of configuration, determine whether to use the image's original size, or adjust it to fit its context. To select an image, determine its resolution, and set its alt text, go to the `image-square` element's *Image* tab.

### Paragraph

Use *paragraph* Fragments to add a simple text element to a Content Page, which can be configured using standard style options and mapped to available content.

### Video

Use *video* Fragments to embed videos in your Content Page. To select a video, enter a valid URL, either to YouTube or video file. As part of configuration, you can set the video to autoplay, loop, or mute. You can also choose to hide video controls.

## Content Display

> Available: Liferay DXP 7.3+

Use *Content Display* Fragments to display Site content individually or as part of a collection. Examples include web content, blog entries, and documents. You can also add page elements for rating or flagging page content. DXP includes the following Content Display Fragments.

### Content Display

Use the *content display* Fragment to display a single content item on a Content Page. As part of configuration, determine whether it displays your selected content using the *Abstract* or *Title* template.

### Content Flags

Use the *content flag* Fragment to add a page element for flagging inappropriate content. As part of configuration, map it to content and determine its message.

### Content Ratings

Use the *content ratings* Fragment to add a page element for rating content. As part of configuration, link it with the desired content item.

### Collection Display

Use the *collection display* Fragment to display asset collections on Content Pages. With it, you can choose from both manually and dynamically defined collections, as well as those defined by a Collection Provider. You can then choose whether a collection is displayed in a *grid* or with a list *template* (i.e., bordered, bulleted, inline, numbered, and unstyled). See [Displaying Collections](../../displaying-content/additional-content-display-options/displaying-collections.md) for more information.

## Featured Content

*Featured Content* Fragments are complex page elements composed of multiple components. To preview a Fragment's layout, hover over its *Information* icon (![Information](../../../images/icon-information.png)). DXP includes the following Featured Content Fragments.

### Banners

Use *banner* Fragments to add text and link elements to a Content Page for creating CTA (Call to Action) banners. DXP includes the following layouts.

## Footers

> Available: Liferay DXP 7.3+; previously included in the *Sections* panel.

Use *Footer* Fragments to add a custom footer to [Master Page Templates](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md) for Content Pages. Each footer includes a navigation menu, sign-in link, image element, and copyright text. DXP includes the following layouts for Footer Fragments:

## Navigation Bars

![Add a custom header to Master Page Templates for Content Page.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/14.png)

## Localizing the Fragment Configuration

> Available: Liferay DXP 7.4+

You can localize the following Fragment settings for the target audience's language:

- [Image Description (*alt text*)](#localizing-alternative-text-for-images)
- [Editable URLs](#localizing-editable-urls)

Additionally, you can change the Fragment configuration fields depending on the Page's target language using the `localizable` attribute. For more information, read the [Fragment Specific Tags and Attributes Reference](../../developer-guide/reference/fragments/fragment-specific-tags-reference.md).

### Localizing Alternative Text for Images

You can add localization in different languages for the image description (also known as *alternative text* or *alt text*) in built-in and custom Fragments. When you change the target language for your Content Page using the language selector in the editor toolbar (A), you can edit the *Image Description* adapting the text for the target language (B).

![You can localize the Image Description in the Content Page editor](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/15.png)

```tip::
    The flag icon next to the Image Description indicates the field as localizable.
```

If the Image Description doesn't have a translation, the description shows the default Content Page language.

### Localizing Editable URLs

When you localize a URL or link in your Content Page, you can redirect to different URLs and content, based on the target language. When you change the target language for your Content Page using the language selector in the editor toolbar (A), you can update the *URL* to the link of your choice (B).

![You can localize the link in the Content Page editor.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/16.png)

You can localize links you enter manually and links from a content field. If the link doesn't have a translation, the active URL is the one for the default Content Page language.
