## Adding Fragments

1. While editing a Content Page, open the *Fragment and Widgets* (![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-cards2.png)) panel in the editing Sidebar Menu.

1. Drag and drop a Fragment to the desired location in your page layout.

Once added, you can change its placement at any time. You can also view its placement in your page's structure as well as access its configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the editing Sidebar Menu.

## Configuring Fragments

Liferay DXP provides options for configuring individual Fragments as well as their sub-elements. These options can vary, though some are common to all. You can view available configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the Sidebar Menu. Click on a Fragment or element and select which options you'd like to configure from the available tabs.

```{note}
You can also localize some Fragment settings for the target audience's language. To learn more, see [Localizing the Fragment Configuration](../../displaying-content/using-fragments/localizing-the-fragment-configuration.md).
```

### General

Here you can configure Fragment specific options (e.g., heading level, video URL, button type).

### Styles

Here you can configure standard Fragment options (e.g., dimensions, background, borders), as well as Fragment specific options on occasion. With DXP's Responsive Layout Editor, you can also configure these settings for different devices. See [Configuring Fragment Styles](../../displaying-content/using-fragments/configuring-fragment-styles.md) and [Fragment Styles Reference](../../displaying-content/using-fragments/fragment-styles-reference.md) for more information.

### Image Source

Here you can select an element's image, view its resolution, and provide its alt text.

### Link

Here you can either manually add a URL to a page element, or select from an available content field. You can also specify the desired target (e.g., self, parent).

### Mapping

Here you can map page elements to available assets by selecting the desired item (e.g., web content article, document, blog) and specifying which of its fields to display in the element (e.g., title, author, name).

## Layout Elements

> Available: Liferay Portal 7.3 GA2+; previously called Layouts with *panels* and *rows*.

*Layout Elements* define drop zones and can be used to create the desired page structure. DXP's default layout Fragments include *Containers* and *Grids*. Once configured, you can drag and drop widgets or other Fragments into the defined areas, including additional containers or grids to create even more complex structures.

![Use Layout Elements to define drop zones and page structure.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/02.png)

### Container

Use *container* Fragments to add drop zones to a Content Page. In addition to standard style options, this field can be configured to maintain a fixed width or to adapt to fill the width of its page section. You can also set a container's Link field to add either internal or external links. Once published, clicking on the name of the fragment redirects users to your specified destination.

### Grid

Use *grid* Fragments to add multiple drop zone modules to a Content Page. These modules can be arranged into rows and columns. In addition to standard style options, you can determine the number of modules for each grid, the number of modules per row, and the vertical alignment of each module's content. You can also manually [adjust the width](./configuring-elements-on-content-pages.md#configuring-the-grid-fragment) of each module.

## Basic Components

These are simple design elements that add basic functionality to a page. Examples include buttons, headings, and tabs. With these Components, you can build your page piece by piece. DXP includes the following Basic Components.

### Button

Use *button* Fragments to add link elements to a Content Page. As part of configuration, choose from one of four available button styles.

### Card

Use *card* Fragments to add an image with title, paragraph, and link elements to a Content Page.

![Add an image with title, paragraph, and link elements to a Content Page.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/04.png)

### Dropdown

> Available: Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4+.

This Fragment defines a drop zone where you can add other Fragments and create advanced drop-down menus (A). For example, you can drag-and-drop a Card Fragment on the Dropdown Fragment's drop zone so the Card content appears when the user clicks or hovers over the Dropdown.

![The Dropdown Fragment defines a drop zone where you can add other fragments.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/01.png)

In this table you can see a description of the Dropdown Fragment General options (B):

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Type* | Controls the Dropdown Fragment style. |
| *Size* | Sets the Dropdown Fragment size. |
| *Panel Type* | Defines the drop zone size:</br><ul><li>*Regular:* Standard drop zone size.</li><li>*Full Width:* The drop zone size corresponds to the Module's width containing the Fragment.</li><li>*Mega Menu:* The drop zone size corresponds to the Page's width.</li></ul> |
| *Display on Hover* | When you check this option, the Dropdown Fragment opens on mouse-over. |
| *Keep Panel Open in Edit Mode* | Check this option to keep the drop-zone open while you edit the Dropdown Fragment content. |

![You can define the drop zone size in the Dropdown panel using the Panel Type options.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/18.png)

```{tip}
Place the Dropdown Fragment inside a Grid Fragment to observe the differences between the *Full Width* and *Mega Menu* panel types.
```

### External Video

> Available: Liferay DXP/Portal 7.4+.

Use the *External Video* Fragment to embed additional video sources in your Content Page. You can use a valid URL or videos in [Documents and Media](../../../content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media.html). The supported sources include YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, Vimeo, and videos stored in Documents and Media.

![The External Video Fragment supports video sources in a valid video URL and Documents and Media](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/16.gif)

```{note}
The External Video Fragment does not support video controls for autoplay, loop, or mute. If you don't need these controls in the Content Page, use the External Video Fragment. If you need to provide these controls, use the [Video URL Fragment](#video-url) instead.
```

### Heading

![Add headings to a Content Page.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/05.png)

### HTML

Use *HTML* Fragments to add an editable HTML element to a Content Page. Double-clicking on it opens a modal window where you can edit its content using HTML syntax.

![Add editable HTML elements to a Content Page.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/06.png)

### Image

Use *image* Fragments to add a configurable `image-square` element to a Content Page. As part of configuration, determine whether to use the image's original size, or adjust it to fit its context. To select an image, determine its resolution, and set its alt text, go to the `image-square` element's *Image* tab.

### Paragraph

![Add icon links for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to a Content Page.](./page-fragments-user-interface-reference/images/08.png)

### Spacer

Use *spacer* Fragments to add horizontal blank space between Fragments on a page. As part of configuration, you can adjust its height.

### Tabs

Use the *tabs* Fragment to add multiple tabs with individual drop zones for widgets and other Fragments. Determine number of tabs, as well as standard style options.

### Video URL

> The Video URL Fragment is called Video Fragment in Liferay versions previous to Liferay DXP 7.4.

Use the *Video URL* Fragment to embed videos in your Content Page. To select a video, enter a valid URL, either to YouTube or a video file. As part of the Fragment configuration, you can set the video to autoplay, loop, or mute. You can also choose to hide the video controls.
