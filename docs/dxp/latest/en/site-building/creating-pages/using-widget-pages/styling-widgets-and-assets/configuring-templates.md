# Configuring Templates

Once you've configured a widget, *Configuration Templates* can save those
settings in a reusable template. If someone goes in and changes the settings of
a particular widget, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back to the
original configuration template. 

```{note}
Configuration templates are only available for widgets placed on a page. Applications available from the Product Menu do not provide configuration templates.
```

To create a configuration template, do as follows:  

1. Click on *Options* (![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) from the menu in the widget's title bar &rarr; select *Configuration Templates*. 

If the widget's current settings are the ones you want to save, click the *Save Current Configuration as Template* button. If not, change the settings until it's configured the way you want it, and then click the button.

1. There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click
*Save*. You should now see your configuration in the list. If you ever need to
revert the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions* (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all widgets in @product@ support this feature. This is
particularly useful for widgets that have a lot of configuration options, such
as the Message Boards application. 

## Summary

You've now explored the configuration options available for Liferay widgets.
You learned how to [customize your widgets](./look-and-feel-configuration.md), [export/import data](./exporting-importing-widget-data.md), [communicate
between widgets](./communication-between-widgets.md), [take advantage of different scopes](./setting-widget-scopes.md), and [save configuration settings](./configuring-templates.md). You also examined the different [uses of social applications](./sharing-widgets-with-other-sites.md) like Facebook and Netvibes for your Liferay widgets. In all, @product@ gives you an abundance of options to leverage the full capability of your widgets.
