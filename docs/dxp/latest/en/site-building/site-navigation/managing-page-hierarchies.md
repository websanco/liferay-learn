# Managing Page Hierarchies

With Liferay, you can organize Pages into hierarchies to achieve the desired structure for your Site. This can be done by directly [adding child Pages](../creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md#adding-a-child-page) to an existing Page or by reorganizing existing Pages into parent/child relationships.

To view a Site's Page hierarchy, open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)), expand *Site Builder*, and click *Pages*.

![Open the Pages application to view and manage your Pages hierarchy.](./managing-page-hierarchies/images/01.png)

The Page listed first is the first Page users see when visiting your Site.

You can drag and drop Pages to reorganize them in the hierarchy. Pages can be nested up to four levels.
