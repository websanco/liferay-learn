# Elasticsearch Connector Configuration Reference

> The configuration information here applies to the latest available (bundled or through Marketplace) version of the Elasticsearch 6 and Elasticsearch 7 connectors for Liferay Portal 7.3 & 7.4 CE and for Liferay DXP 7.2 & 7.3. Appropriate information about the exact GA/Service Pack/Fix Pack and Marketplace versions are provided where needed.

The connection to Elasticsearch is primarily defined in the _Elasticsearch 6/7_ configuration entry in System Settings (or via [corresponding configuration file](#configuration-files-and-system-settings-entries)). Liferay 7.3 introduced the possibility to define multiple connections to Elasticsearch, through the [factory configuration](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/configuration-files-and-factories/using-factory-configuration.md) _Elasticsearch Connections_. Both configuration entries are configurable through [System Settings](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/system-settings.md) or an [OSGi configuration file](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/configuration-files-and-factories/using-configuration-files.md). Configuration files are the recommended approach for production environments.

## Configuration Files and System Settings Entries

| Connecting Servers | <div style="width:380px">System Settings Entry/Configuration File</div> |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | 
| Liferay 7.2.x<br />Elasticsearch 6.x  | Elasticsearch 6<br />`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config` |
| Liferay 7.2.x<br />Elasticsearch 7.x  | Elasticsearch 7<br />`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config` |
| Liferay 7.3.x<br />Elasticsearch 7.x  | Elasticsearch 7<br />`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config`<br /><br />Elasticsearch Connections (factory)<br />`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConnectionConfiguration-[connectionId].config` |

In Liferay 7.3 and beyond, there's an additional connection configuration entry, Elasticsearch Connections. You can use this to define any connection to Elasticsearch, but if you are only configuring one connection you can still use the main Elasticsearch 7 configuration entry. If using multiple connections in 7.3+, define connections with files named accordingly:

```
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConnectionConfiguration-[connectionId].config
```

If configuring security on Elasticsearch 6, a separate Liferay configuration (as well as a LES subscription) is required. See [Securing Elasticsearch](securing-elasticsearch.md) for more information.

Deploy configuration files to `[Liferay_Home]/osgi/configs` and a listener auto-detects the configurations and writes them to the database.

## Configuration Properties

| Production Mode Enabled | <details><summary>`productionModeEnabled=B"false"`</summary>Enable production mode. In Liferay 7.3, <code>productionModeEnabled</code> replaces the deprecated setting <code>operationMode</code>. If this is checked, production mode is enabled and the Operation Mode configuration is ignored. Enabling production mode requires connecting to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. If left disabled, the Operation Mode configuration is used.</details> | Liferay 7.3+ |
