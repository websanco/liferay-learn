Elements are one of the fundamental building blocks of [Search Blueprints](understanding-search-blueprints.md) and are managed within the Blueprints application. Open the Global menu's Applications section and find the Search Experiences category to open Search Blueprints. Click the _Elements_ tab to add a new Element and manage existing Elements.
