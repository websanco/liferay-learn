Liferay provides applications you can use to create and manage your content. These applications include [Web Content](./content-authoring-and-management/web-content/web-content-articles/adding-a-basic-web-content-article.md), [Documents and Media](./content-authoring-and-management/documents-and-media/documents-and-media-overview.md), [Collections](./content-authoring-and-management/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md), and more. You can use these applications directly in each of your Sites, or create [Asset Libraries](./content-authoring-and-management/asset-libraries/asset-libraries-overview.md) to create instance-scoped assets and Collections that can be shared across Sites. [Tags and Categories](./content-authoring-and-management/tags_and_categories.html) make it easier to organize, find, and display your content.
