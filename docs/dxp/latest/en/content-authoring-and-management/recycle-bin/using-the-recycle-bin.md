# Using the Recycle Bin

Recycle Bin functionality is available for the following assets:

* Blogs
* Bookmarks
* Documents and Media
* Folders
* Message Boards (and attachments)
* Web Content
* Wiki (and attachments)

```note::
   Attachments added to Wiki and Message Board entries do not go to the Recycle Bin when they are deleted. They can be restored in a similar fashion from the *Removed Attachments* menu within the application.
```
