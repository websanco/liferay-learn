Elasticsearch
=============

   elasticsearch/*

Elasticsearch is the highly scalable, full-text search engine Liferay uses by default. Elasticsearch is bundled with Liferay for non-production purposes. In production, Liferay requires Elasticsearch running on separate remote server.

.. important::
   Always check the `compatibility matrix <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002103292-Compatibility-Matrix>`__ for the Elasticsearch version and server configuration compatible with your Liferay version.


.. important::
   Liferay 7.2 and 7.3 include support for Elasticsearch 7 and securing authenticated, encrypted Elasticsearch connections. Securing the Elasticsearch 6 connector (available on Liferay 7.2) requires an additional module only available with a `Liferay Enterprise Search subscription <../liferay_enterprise_search.md>`__.
