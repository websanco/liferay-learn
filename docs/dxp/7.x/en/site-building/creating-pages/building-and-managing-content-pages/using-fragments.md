# Using Fragments

Page *Fragments* are extensible, reusable, drag-and-drop elements that serve as the primary building blocks for Content Pages. Each Fragment is built using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Together, Fragments define your page's design and provide functionality along with widgets. Though you can [create your own](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/developing-fragments-intro.md), Liferay DXP includes a number of Fragments out-of-the-box.

To access available Fragments, go to a Content Page, and click on the *Edit* icon (![Edit](../../../images/icon-edit.png)) in the Application Bar. Ensure your edit mode is set to *Page Design* and click on *Fragment and Widgets* (![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-cards2.png)) in the editing Sidebar Menu.

## Adding Fragments

1. While editing a Content Page, open the *Fragment and Widgets* (![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-cards2.png)) panel in the editing Sidebar Menu.

1. Drag and drop a Fragment to the desired location in your page layout.

Once added, you can change its placement at any time. You can also view its placement in your page's structure as well as access its configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the editing Sidebar Menu.

## Configuring Fragments

DXP provides options for configuring individual Fragments as well as their sub-elements. These options can vary, though some are common to all. You can view available configuration options in the *Selection* panel (![Selection](../../../images/icon-pages-tree.png)) of the Sidebar Menu. Click on a Fragment or element and select which options you'd like to configure from the available tabs.

### General

Here you can configure Fragment specific options (e.g., heading level, video URL, button type).

### Styles

Here you can configure standard Fragment options (e.g., dimensions, background, borders), as well as Fragment specific options on occasion. With DXP's Responsive Layout Editor, you can also configure these settings for different devices. See [Configuring Fragment Styles](./configuring-fragment-styles.md) and [Fragment Styles Reference](./fragment-styles-reference.md) for more information.

### Image

Here you can select an element's image, view its resolution, and provide its alt text.

### Link

Here you can either manually add a URL to a page element, or select from an available content field. You can also specify the desired target (e.g., self, parent).

### Mapping

Here you can map page elements to available assets by selecting the desired item (e.g., web content article, document, blog) and specifying which of its fields to display in the element (e.g., title, author, name).

## Layout Elements

> Available: Liferay Portal CE 7.3 GA2+; previously called Layouts with *panels* and *rows*.

*Layout Elements* define drop zones and can be used to create the desired page structure. DXP's default layout Fragments include *Containers* and *Grids*. Once configured, you can drag and drop widgets or other Fragments into the defined areas, including additional containers or grids to create even more complex structures.

![Use Layout Elements to define drop zones and page structure.](./using-fragments/images/02.png)

### Container

Use *container* Fragments to add drop zones to a Content Page. In addition to standard style options, this field can be configured to maintain a fixed width or to adapt to fill the width of its page section. You can also set a container's Link field to add either internal or external links. Once published, clicking on the name of the fragment redirects users to your specified destination.

### Grid

Use *grid* Fragments to add multiple drop zone modules to a Content Page. These modules can be arranged into rows and columns. In addition to standard style options, you can determine the number of modules for each grid, the number of modules per row, and the vertical alignment of each module's content. You can also manually [adjust the width](./building-content-pages.md#configuring-a-row-s-columns) of each module.

## Basic Components

These are simple design elements that add basic functionality to a page. Examples include buttons, headings, and tabs. With these Components, you can build your page piece by piece. DXP includes the following Basic Components.

### Button

Use *button* Fragments to add link elements to a Content Page. As part of configuration, choose from one of four available button styles.

### Image

Use *image* Fragments to add a configurable `image-square` element to a Content Page. As part of configuration, determine whether to use the image's original size, or adjust it to fit its context. To select an image, determine its resolution, and set its alt text, go to the `image-square` element's *Image* tab.

### Paragraph

Use *paragraph* Fragments to add a simple text element to a Content Page, which can be configured using standard style options and mapped to available content.

### Separator

Use *separator* Fragments to add a horizontal line between Fragments on a page. As part of configuration, you can determine its spacing and color.

### Slider

Use *slider* Fragments to add image slides with text overlay to a Content Page. Each slide consists of image, title, and subtitle elements.

## Content Display

> Available: Liferay DXP 7.3+

Use *Content Display* Fragments to display Site content individually or as part of a collection. Examples include web content, blog entries, and documents. You can also add page elements for rating or flagging page content. DXP includes the following Content Display Fragments.

### Content Display

Use the *content display* Fragment to display a single content item on a Content Page. As part of configuration, determine whether it displays your selected content using the *Abstract* or *Title* template.

### Content Flags

Use the *content flag* Fragment to add a page element for flagging inappropriate content. As part of configuration, map it to content and determine its message.

### Content Ratings

Use the *content ratings* Fragment to add a page element for rating content. As part of configuration, link it with the desired content item.

You can then choose whether a collection is displayed in a *grid* or with a list *template* (i.e., bordered, bulleted, inline, numbered, and unstyled). See [Collection Display Fragments](../../displaying-content/displaying-collections-and-collection-pages/collection-display-fragments.md) for more information.
