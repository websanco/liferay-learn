# Building Content Pages

```note::
   This information applies to Liferay DXP 7.3+. For previous Liferay DXP versions, see ![Liferay DXP 7.1 and 7.2](#liferay-dxp-7.1-and-7.2).
```

Once you've [added a Content Page](../adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md), you may begin building your page by adding and configuring the various [Content Page elements](./content-pages-overview.md).

1. Open the Product Menu and, under the Site Menu, go to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* to open the Site Builder.
1. Click the Add Page button (![Add Page](../../../images/icon-plus.png)) at the level where you want to add the new page, and select *Add Page*.

    ![Begin by adding your new Content Page.](building-content-pages/images/01.png)

1. Select the *Blank* template or one of the exiting templates.
1. In the *Add Page* dialog, type your page's *Name*.
1. Alternatively, click the Actions Menu (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) of an existing Content Page and select *Edit*.

    ![Edit an existing Content Page](building-content-pages/images/02.png)

    When you enter the Site Builder view, you can add or edit your content using two different editing modes:
    
    - *Page Design*: Using this mode, you can edit the page design and content. This option is only available for users with the permissions to update the page and the page content.
    - *Content Edition*: Using this mode, you can only edit the content. This options is available for users with permission to update the page, but not the page content.
    
    The editing options available in the Content Page sidebar depend on the editing mode you choose.
    
    ![Choose between Page Design or Content Edition editing modes.](building-content-pages/images/18.png)

1. From the Content Page sidebar, select the *Fragments and Widgets* button (![Fragments and Widgets](../../../images/icon-cards2.png)) and start adding the Fragments and Widgets for your content.

    ![Add Fragments and Widgets from the Content Page sidebar](building-content-pages/images/03.png)

    ```note::
       New Content Pages start empty and in a *Draft* status. The page is not visible until it is published.
    ```

1. Configure the look and content preferences of the Fragments and Widgets using the following configuration options:

    * [Setting the Layout Style](#setting-the-layout-style)
    * [Editing Text Inline](#editing-text-inline)
    * [Editing Hyperlinks](#editing-hyperlinks)
    * [Editing Images](#editing-images)
    * [Configuring the Grid Layout](#configuring-the-grid-layout)
    * [Copying a Fragment](#copying-a-fragment)
    * [Saving a Fragment Composition](#saving-a-fragment-composition)
    * [Mapping Content](#mapping-content)

    ![Modify the Fragments to display the content you want.](./building-content-pages/images/04.png)

    ```tip::
       In progress work on a Content Page is automatically saved.
    ```

1. You can revert any action using the *Undo* (![Preview](../../../images/icon-undo.png)) or *Redo* (![Preview](../../../images/icon-redo.png)) buttons, or you can return to a previous version of your edits using the *History* (![Preview](../../../images/icon-time.png)) button.

    ![Revert your changes using the Undo, Redo, and History buttons.](./building-content-pages/images/17.png)

1. To preview your Content Page, click the *Preview* button (![Preview](../../../images/icon-preview.png)).
1. Click the *Publish* button in the top right to make the updates available to the live page.

## Configuring Elements on a Content Page

Many elements that can be added to a content page can be configured and customized. When you click on an element, the Content Page sidebar shows the available configuration options for the element.

    * *Save Mapping Configuration* option, for including [mapped content](#mapping-content).
    * *Collection* to save the Fragment.

      ![Provide the information for the Fragment composition in the dialog that appears.](./building-content-pages/images/12.png)

```note::
   If no Site-specific Fragment Collection exists, the saved Fragment composition is automatically saved to a new Fragment Collection called Saved Fragments.
```

You can use the saved Fragment composition immediately using the Fragments sidebar or through the Page Fragments administrative application.

![The saved Fragment composition can be used immediately.](./building-content-pages/images/13.png)

Compositions can be exported or imported between sites just as any other Fragment.

```note::
  The latest version of the `Liferay Fragments Toolkit <../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/using-the-fragments-editor.md>`_ supports creation, export/import, and preview of Fragment compositions.
```

### Mapping Content

You can also map these elements to existing content. You can set the *Content* for the element (web content article, document, or blog) and choose its applicable *Field* to display (e.g., title, author name, tags, etc.).

To map your elements to existing content:

1. Click the Grid element you want to map.
1. In the Content Page sidebar, under the *Mapping* tab, click the *Add* button (![Map](../../../images/icon-plus.png)).
1. Select the content you want to map to your Content Page element.
1. Select the *Field* of your content that you want to map.

## Liferay DXP 7.1 and 7.2

<!-- This content belongs to the "Content Page Elements" article in Liferay Help Center. -->

Content Pages, like Widget Pages, are built by dragging and dropping elements
onto the page and then configuring the way those elements appear. There are
three kinds of elements: 

**Sections** are fragments that define a space to place other elements.
A section fills the entire width of the page. Sections can be thought of as
*complete* Fragments that serve a purpose by themselves. A large banner image
with a text overlay is an example of something you might build as a section.

![Figure 1: A Section named Banner being displayed while editing a Content Page.](./building-content-pages/images/20.png)

**Layouts** are special Sections that define spaces where you can add fragments
or widgets. Each layout you add fills the width of the page. You can add any
number of layouts to the page.

![Figure 2: A 3 Column and 1 Column layout stacked on top of each other.](./building-content-pages/images/21.png)

**Components** are small design elements or pieces that add functionality to the
page. A component might be an image with formatting or a block of text with
styling pre-applied. Components must be added to the page inside a Layout. If
you add a component outside an existing Layout, a one column layout is
automatically added to contain the Component. While Sections should be complete
by themselves, Components work together to build pages piece by piece.

![Figure 3: Here are several of Liferay's out of the box components arranged in the layout you saw previously.](./building-content-pages/images/22.png)

Liferay DXP ships with a plethora of Layouts, Sections, and Components to use to
build pages, and a
[web developer can create their own Fragments](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032884532-Creating-Page-Fragments) to add to these. 

## Editable Elements

Fragments can have editable elements. After a Fragment has been added to a page,
you can click on an editable area to provide your own text, image, or links in
place of the default defined in the Fragment.

You can also map these elements to content. You can set the *Content* for the
element (web content article, document, or blog) and choose its applicable
*Field* to display (e.g., title, author name, tags, etc.). You can configure
this by selecting the element's *Map* button
(![Map](../../../images/icon-map.png)).

```note::
   Many mapping improvements were released in Liferay DXP 7.2 SP1+ and Liferay Portal 7.2 GA2+. For example, mapping editables to text/URL fields of existing content and mapping Fragment background images to image fields of existing content. You can also map [custom fields](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028818872-Custom-Fields). To ensure you leverage the latest editable element mapping features, upgrade to these versions.
```

For more information on developing these elements, see 
[Fragment Specific Tags](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147771-Fragment-Specific-Tags).

Now you'll learn about each editable type.

### Editable Text

Editable text can be plain or rich text. Plain text has no special styling. Rich
text enables text styles, typographical emphasis, alignment, and list
formatting.

![Figure 4: The rich text editor provides a simple WYSIWYG interface with a number of formatting options.](./building-content-pages/images/23.png)

### Editable Images

Editable image elements allow replacing the image URL or an image from your
Documents and Media library. You can provide a link target for the image.

To edit an image from the Content Page editor,

1.  Click on the image you want to replace.

2.  Click ![Image Properties](../../../images/icon-edit.png).

![Figure 5: Editing an image allows you to enter a URL, select an image from Documents and Media or set a link for the image.](./building-content-pages/images/24.png)

From here, you can click *Select* to upload an image from Docs and Media or
define an image URL. Click *Clear* to reset the image. You can also specify an
image description.

You can also specify a background image for a layout from Section Builder. Click
the Layout, select *Layout Background Image*, and define the image to display.

```note::
   Mapping a Layout background image is available in Liferay DXP 7.2 SP1+ and Liferay Portal 7.2 GA2+.
```

For more information on developing editable images, see 
[Making Images Editable](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147771-Fragment-Specific-Tags#making-images-editable).

You can also define a link for your image. You'll learn about this next.

### Editable Links

Editable links can be associated with entities that redirect you to a content
type or Page (e.g., buttons).

To edit a link from the content page editor,

1.  Click on the link or button that you want to edit.

2.  Click on ![Edit](../../../images/icon-edit.png) to edit the link text.

3.  Click on ![Link](../../../images/icon-link.png) to edit the link properties.

4.  Click on ![Map](../../../images/icon-map.png) to edit the link mapping
    (described earlier).

From the Link Properties popup, you can define the following link options:

*Manual:* defines a manual link or map it to an existing content field.

- *URL:* sets the link's URL.
- *Target:* set the link's behavior.

*From Content Field:* 

- *Content:* sets the content type.
- *Field:* sets the field to display for the selected content.

Some of the content fields include

- Categories
- Tags
- Display Page URL
- Description
- Publish Date
- Summary
- Title
- Last Editor Name
- Author Name
- Basic Web Content

For more information on developing editable links, see 
[Creating Editable Links](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147771-Fragment-Specific-Tags#creating-editable-links).

Next you'll learn about the Content Page Editing Interface.
