# Displaying Content

You can display [content](TODO) in various ways. The option you choose depends on the type of asset you want to display, how many assets you want to display at once, and how you want your content to be viewed. Three key options are available: The Web Content Display widget, the Asset Publisher widget, and Display Page Templates. The table below compares the key behaviors of these display options:

| Behavior | Web Content Display | Asset Publisher | Display Pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display individual content | &#10004; | | &#10004; |
| Supports multiple content types | | &#10004; | &#10004; |
| Supports Manual content selection | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; |
| Display multiple pieces of content | | &#10004; |  |
| Supports Dynamic content selection | | &#10004; | |
| Displays content on its own page | | | &#10004; |
| Provides a unique friendly URL for a web content | | | &#10004; |

## Web Content Display Widget

The Web Content Display widget displays individual web content articles. It provides customizable features that you can enable for users, such as comments and print options.

## The Asset Publisher

The Asset Publisher displays multiple pieces of content at a time. It can display any kind of asset.

You can specify which assets to display. For instance you can specify to only display the assets that meet specific conditions, such as specific tags or keywords. You can manually select the assets to create a static collection of assets, or you can configure it to dynamically select content on the fly.

## Display Page Template

A Display Page Template defines how your web content is organized and formatted on a page. When the full web content is viewed, either through an app like the Asset Publisher or directly via the friendly URL for the web content, it's displayed on its own page, based on the Display Page Template.

## Other

If you need to embed content from another URL, you can [use the IFrame widget](TODO:using-widgets). For instance, you can include multimedia (videos, interactive elements, etc.) or display advertisements in the iframe.
