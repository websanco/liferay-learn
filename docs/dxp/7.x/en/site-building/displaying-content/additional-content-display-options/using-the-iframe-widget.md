   Click *Save*. 

   Note that not all websites allow you to display their page in an *Iframe* widget.

## Using the Iframe Widget

Using the *Iframe* widget is as simple as navigating any other typical website. Once you have finished setting up your widget, you can navigate to your page and view the embedded website.

You can interact with the website from within the widget without ever having to leave your page.
