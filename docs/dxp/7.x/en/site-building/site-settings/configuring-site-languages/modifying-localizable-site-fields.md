# Modifying Localizable Site Fields

Some Site setting fields have a language flag appended to the end. These fields can be translated into other languages.

Liferay DXP automatically saves the translation for each language and displays the translated value when that specific language is selected for the instance. If a translation for the field is not provided, the default instance language's value for that field is displayed.
