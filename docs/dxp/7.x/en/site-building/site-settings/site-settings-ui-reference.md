## General

General settings range from core configuration, like a Site's Membership Type, to finer details like Documents and Media indexing options. The tab's content is organized into the following subsections: Details, Pages, Categorization, Site URL, Documents and Media, Open Graph, Asset Auto Tagging, Sharing, and Custom Fields.

### Details

**Site ID**: A unique number automatically generated for a Site at its creation. This ID is permanent and cannot be changed.

**Name**: Set a Site's title using the *Name* field. This title is displayed in the browser's title bar as well as the header for each Site page. You can also localize a Site's name via the *Language Flag* button.

**Description**: Use the *Description* field to explain a Site's purpose. You can also localize a Site's description via the *Language Flag* button.

**Active**: Determine whether a Site is *Active* or *Inactive*. While inactive, a site is inaccessible to users, though it can be reactivated if desired.

**Membership Type**: A *Membership Type* determines how restrictive a Site's membership is. See [Changing Site Membership Types](./site-users/changing-site-membership-type.md) for more information.

**Allow Manual Membership Management**: Determine whether to allow members to be manually added or removed from a Site. If your Site's membership is handled automatically by a membership policy, you can disable this setting. See [Managing Membership Policies for Sites](./site-users/changing-site-membership-type.md) for more information.

**Parent Site**: Designate a Site as a child Site by selecting its parent Site. See [Site Hierarchies](../building-sites/site-hierarchies.md) for more information.

**Limit Membership to Parent Site Members**: Determine whether a child Site's membership is limited to members of its parent Site.

![In the Details section you can view and edit a site's name, description, status, and more.](./site-settings-ui-reference/images/02.png)

### Pages

Here you can view a Site's Public and Private pages, if any exist. If they don't exist, a *Site Templates* selector appears for creating pages with a template.

![In the Pages section, you can view a Site's public and private pages.](./site-settings-ui-reference/images/03.png)

### Custom Fields

Here you can view and configure any custom fields you've defined for your pages. With these fields, you can set page metadata, such as author, date of creation, and geolocation. This section only appears once you've configured custom fields for your Site. See [Custom Fields](../../installation-and-upgrades/setting-up-liferay-dxp/custom-fields.md) for more information.

### Categorization

Here you can categorize Site content using *Topics* and *Tags*. These tools help organize sites so users can more easily find your site's content via search and navigation widgets. See [Organizing Content with Tags and Categories](../../content-authoring-and-management/index.html#tags-and-categories) for more information.

### Open Graph

**Enable Open Graph**: Determine whether to embed [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` of your Site's pages. These tags define page metadata to create engaging representations of your Site's content when shared in applications that support the Open Graph protocol, such as Facebook, Slack, and Twitter.

**Open Graph Image**: Use the *Image* and *Alt Description* fields to define the default `og:image` and `og:image:alt` properties used for Site pages. You can also localize the image's alt description via the *Language Flag* button. See [Configuring Open Graph](./configuring-open-graph.md) to learn more.
