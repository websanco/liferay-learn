# Deploying Changes via the DXP Cloud Console

This tutorial walks through the process of adding a portal property to the Liferay service, triggering a CI build with a pull request, and deploying the new build to the `dev` environment via the DXP Cloud console.

To get started, you need a code hosting service integrated with your project's CI service and a local, working copy of your project's repository.

```{note}
For an alternative deployment workflow, see [Deploying Changes via the CLI Tool](./deploying-changes-via-the-cli-tool.md)_ to learn how to deploy local changes to your project environments using the Liferay Cloud Platform CLI tool.

## Adding a Portal Property to the Liferay Service

Begin the deployment life cycle by adding a portal property to the `dev` environment's Liferay service and committing your changes:

1. Ensure your local master branch is up-to-date with the latest version of your project's repository.

1. Create a new working branch based on your up-to-date master branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b example-console-deployment-branch
   ```

1. Go to `<project>\liferay\configs\dev\portal-env.properties`, and add the following property:

   ```properties
   web.server.display.node=true
   ```

   ```{note}
   If you're using version 3.x.x services, then the appropriate folder path is `lcp/liferay/deploy/dev`. See [DXP Cloud Project Changes in Version 4](../reference/dxp-cloud-project-changes-in-version-4.md)_ for more information on the differences in the directory structure, and [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md)_ for how to check the version of your services.
   ```

1. Add and commit your changes to the `portal-env.properties` file with the following commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Test - Adding Portal Property"
   ```

## Triggering a Jenkins Build with a Pull Request

Next, trigger a Jenkins build with a pull request to your project's central Git repository:

1. Push your new branch to the origin of your local repository.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin example-console-deployment-branch
   ```

1. Navigate to your Git repository, and trigger a Jenkins build with a new pull request to your project's central repository.

   You can track the status of your build and view detailed logs via your project's Jenkins page: `https://ci-<project-name>-infra.lfr.cloud`

## Deploying Your New Build via the DXP Cloud Console

Once your new build is ready, deploy it to your project's `dev` environment via the DXP Cloud console:

1. Navigate to the *Builds* page for your project in the DXP Cloud console. You can access this page from any project environment.

1. Click on the *Actions* button ( ⋮ ) for the build you want to deploy, and select *Deploy Build To...*

   ![View and deploy builds from the Builds page.](./deploying-changes-via-the-dxp-cloud-console/images/04.png)

1. Use the drop-down menu to select the `dev` environment.

   ![Select the dev environment, and click on Deploy Build.](./deploying-changes-via-the-dxp-cloud-console/images/05.png)

1. Use the checkboxes to confirm your deployment, and click on *Deploy Build*.

   ```{tip}
   You can also access the *Deploy Build to...* page by clicking on the *Build ID* for the build you want to deploy.
   ```

   You can view the status of your deployment from the *Deployments* page, as well as the *Logs* and *Activities* pages of the `dev` environment.

## Verifying Your Sample Deployment

Once your build has successfully deployed and your `dev` environment's Liferay service is *Ready*, follow these steps to verify your changes:

1. Navigate to your project's `dev` environment.

1. Go to the *Web Server* service's page, and click on its URL to access the `dev` environment's DXP instance: `https://webserver-<project-name>-dev.lfr.cloud/`.

   ![Click on the Web Server url to access the dev environment's DXP instance.](./deploying-changes-via-the-dxp-cloud-console/images/08.png)

1. Verify the web server node is displayed at the bottom of the Home Page.
