# Support Access

Support Access is an optional setting that expedites troubleshooting by giving Liferay engineers direct access to a DXP Cloud project environment. DXP Cloud administrators can enable or disable Support Access for individual project environments.

When Support Access is enabled, Liferay Support engineers have read access to the following information:

* Project console
* Service logs
* Control Panel settings
* The region where the DXP Cloud services are hosted
* Team members and their associated roles
* Members' activities

```note::
   Support Access **does not** allow Liferay Support engineers to deploy assets or perform write actions in your project.
```

## Changing the Support Access Setting

Support Access is enabled by default in each environment, but administrators can disable it at any time.

Follow these steps to change the Support Access setting:

1. Navigate to *Settings* &rarr; *Support Access*.
1. Set the toggle switch to your desired setting (*Enabled* or *Disabled*).

## Monitoring Changes to Support Access

Any change to Support Access registers a new activity that lists who made that change and when. These activities appear in *Activities* &rarr; *General*.

DXP Cloud also sends an email to all team members when the Support Access setting changes.
