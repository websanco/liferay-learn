# Troubleshooting Tools and Resources

The ability to quickly diagnose and resolve technical issues is vital. Familiarize yourself with the available tools and resources for troubleshooting problems in your Liferay DXP Cloud projects:

* [Application Metrics](#application-metrics)
* [Real-Time Alerts](#real-time-alerts)
* [Environment Activities](#environment-activities)
* [Environment Logs](#environment-service-logs)
* [Shell Access](#shell-access)
* [Self-Healing](#self-healing)
* [Disaster Recovery](#disaster-recovery)
* [Liferay Cloud Platform Status](#liferay-cloud-platform-status)
* [Support Access](#support-access)
* [Help Center](#help-center)

With these tools and resources, you can track project activities, configure services, resolve technical issues, and more.

## Application Metrics

With Liferay DXP Cloud’s built-in monitoring, users can track resources used by each environment service. These application metrics include memory and CPU usage, as well as network data transfer.

Metrics are available for the default DXP Cloud stack services: Webserver, Liferay, Search, Database, and Backup. CI metrics are also available in the infra environment.

![Figure 1: View application metrics via the Monitoring page in the DXP Cloud console](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/01.png)

Users can also integrate [Dynatrace’s](../manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md#advanced-application-metrics-production-only) advanced performance monitoring with production environments.

See [Application Metrics](../manage-and-optimize/application-metrics.md) for more information.

## Real-Time Alerts

Liferay DXP Cloud can alert system administrators of unexpected behaviors in a project. Examples of unexpected behaviors include auto-scaling events, higher than expected memory consumption, reaching the allotted CPU quota, and database connection issues.

View all environment alerts and set alert preferences via the DXP Cloud console.

![Figure 2: View and manage alerts via the Alerts page in the DXP Cloud console](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/02.png)

See [Real-Time Alerts](../manage-and-optimize/real-time-alerts.md) for more information.

## Environment Activities

Users can monitor environment activities via the DXP Cloud console, where they are sorted into two sections: *Builds and Deployments* and *General Activities*.

View the status of builds, deployments, service activities, and more to help troubleshoot environment issues.

![Figure 3: View environment activities from the DXP Cloud console](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/03.png)

See [Team Activities](../manage-and-optimize/team-activities.md) for more information.

## Environment Logs

Environment logs are crucial for diagnosing and resolving technical issues in a project. Users can access and download environment logs via the DXP Cloud console or your OS terminal.

Application, status, and build logs are provided for each DXP Cloud Service:

* **Application Logs**: These logs list runtime information generated after the application is running and accessed by users.
* **Status Logs**: These logs list orchestration layer information from the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Build Logs**: These logs list build information generated as the application boots up.

![Figure 4: View logs via the Logs page in the DXP Cloud console](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/04.png)

See [Log Management](./reading-dxp-cloud-service-logs.md) for more information.

## Shell Access

Command-line tools in the DXP Cloud console contribute to the developer's workflow by delivering speed, control, traceability, scripting, and automation capabilities.

When troubleshooting issues, use the shell access tool to look inside your applications and see details not easily spotted in logs.

![Figure 5: Use the shell access tool in the DXP Cloud console to see what's going on inside your application.](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/05.png)

The shell is accessible in most services, including the `liferay`, `search`, and `webserver` services. It can be used to access the server's file system directly and run commands for troubleshooting purposes.

For example, you can run the following command from the `liferay` service's shell to test connection to an address or external server:

```bash
curl -v [address]
```

See [Shell Access](./shell-access.md) for more information.

## Self-Healing

The self-healing functionality of DXP Cloud detects if a service or application has become unresponsive and automatically initiates procedures to recover the unresponsive service. The platform uses probes to monitor the services.

DXP Cloud offers two probes used in conjunction to manage applications:

* **Liveness Probe**: This probe indicates whether the service is running.
* **Readiness Probe**: This probe indicates whether the service is ready to receive requests.

See [Self-Healing](./self-healing.md) for more information about configuring each probe.

## Disaster Recovery

In the event of a disaster, Liferay DXP Cloud offers two strategies for project recovery: Automatic and Cross-Region.

Liferay DXP Cloud's automatic disaster recovery strategy replicates services between three availability zones within the same region. If an availability zone becomes unavailable, the load balancer will automatically route to the remaining availability zones without the need for user action.

However, in a cross-region disaster, user intervention is required. To learn more about cross-region disaster recovery tools and processes, see [Configuring Cross Region Disaster Recovery](./configuring-cross-region-disaster-recovery.md).

See [Disaster Recovery Overview](./disaster-recovery-overview.md) to learn more about both disaster recovery strategies.

## Liferay Cloud Platform Status

When troubleshooting technical issues, be sure to check that all Cloud Platform systems are operational.

Users can view the status of Liferay Cloud Platform systems, planned maintenance windows, and incident history from the [Liferay Cloud Platform](https://status.liferay.cloud/) status page.

To receive notifications of changes in the Cloud Platform's status, click on *Subscribe to Updates*, and select your preferred method of notification.

![Figure 6: View the status of Liferay Cloud Platform systems.](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/06.png)

See [Liferay Cloud Platform Status](./liferay-cloud-platform-status) for more information.

## Support Access

Support Access is an optional environment setting that expedites troubleshooting by giving Liferay engineers direct access to a DXP Cloud project environment.

By default, Support Access is enabled in each project environment, though administrators can disable it from the *Settings* page.

![Figure 07: Environment administrators can enable or disable Support Access in the Settings page](./troubleshooting-tools-and-resources/images/07.png)

See [Support Access](./support-access.md) for more information.
