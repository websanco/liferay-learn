To enable Guest Checkout:

1. Navigate to the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Commerce_.
1. Click _Channels_ under _Store Management_.

    ![Access Commerce settings in the Global Commerce menu.](./enabling-guest-checkout/images/04.png)

1. Click on the desired channel (for example _Everest Portal_).
1. On the _General_ tab's _Orders_ section, slide the _Guest Checkout_ toggle to Enabled.
1. Click _Save_.

    ![Enable Guest Checkout](./enabling-guest-checkout/images/01.png)

Guest Checkout has been enabled.

Guest customers can now add items to the cart and proceed to checkout without logging in. After clicking _Submit_, they will see the Email Address field during the checkout process.

## Adding the Continuing as Guest Option

To allow customers to continue their checkout process as a Guest user, you can create a separate authentication page where guest customers have several checkout options.

* They can sign in if they have an account. They can view all their account information, including past orders.
* They can create a new account if they are a new customer.
* They can continue as a Guest, entering only the data necessary to complete the transaction. They can register later or log in now to make future orders more easily.

Follow the steps below to generate this authentication page:

1. Navigate to the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Commerce_.
1. Click _Channels_ under _Store Management_.
