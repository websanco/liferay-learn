# Setting Inventory by Warehouse

Stores with multiple warehouses can manage product inventory on a per warehouse basis. The _Inventory_ menu is where users manage the number of products available for sale in each warehouse. If the [Minium Accelerator](../../starting-a-store/using-the-minium-accelerator-to-jump-start-your-b2b-store.md) was used to create the store, there are three warehouses already created.

1. Go to  _Global Applications_ → _Commerce_ → _Products_.
1. Click on a product (for example _U-Joint_).
1. Click the _SKUs_ sub-tab.
1. Click on the SKU ID (_MIN-55861_).
1. Click _Inventory_ on the left menu.
1. Enter a quantity for the corresponding warehouse(s).
