# Setting Rates for Tax Calculations

Liferay Commerce includes built-in tools for defining and applying tax rates to Product and shipping costs. These rates are calculated using configurable Tax Engines and are added to [Tax Categories](./creating-tax-categories.md). You can then [apply tax rates](./applying-tax-rates.md) to Channel Products and shipping costs by assigning the Tax Category to them.

## Understanding Tax Engines

Commerce tax engines define calculations for tax rates when a transaction is made. Liferay provides two out-of-the-box engines (i.e., *Fixed Tax Rate* and *By Address*), though you can design and implement [custom engines](../../developer-guide/implementing-a-new-tax-engine.md).

```note::
   Tax Categories can contain multiple tax rates created using either the same or different tax engine.
```

### Fixed Tax Rate

The *Fixed Tax Rate* engine applies the same rate for all Products and shipping costs to which it's category is assigned. This rate is applied regardless of the buyer's location.

### By Address

The *By Address* engine applies specific rates based on the buyer's location and uses the buyer's billing or shipping address. If there are multiple By Address rates for a Tax Category, only the rates appropriate to the buyer’s location are applied.

```note::
   You must save your changes before navigating to another tab. Otherwise, they are lost.
