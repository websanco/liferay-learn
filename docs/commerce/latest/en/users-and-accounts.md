Liferay Commerce provides specialized roles out of the box to satisfy e-commerce needs. These roles are included alongside the [standard DXP roles](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/default-roles-reference.html) and define basic user profiles for B2B and B2C solutions. If desired, you can create or modify roles to meet the needs of your specific use case. When doing this, you can use Commerce's extensive list of fine-grained permissions to manage user access to applications and resources.

Commerce also introduces Account entities for managing users in the e-commerce context. Accounts are used to store customer information (e.g., billing and shipping addresses, order details, VAT number). In the B2B context, they allow customers to easily integrate a purchasing workflow. Accounts can also be organized into Account Groups that can be targeted with specific Price Lists, Promotions, and Discounts.
