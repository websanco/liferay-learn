## Understanding Discount Specificity

If an order is eligible for multiple discounts, the discount's rules and eligibility determine whether it qualifies or not. See the table below to understand discount specificity for the given eligibility.

| **Account** | **Account Group** | **Channel** | **Order Type** | **Rank** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| &#10004; | | &#10004; | &#10004; | 1 |
| &#10004; | | | &#10004; | 2 |
| &#10004; | | &#10004; | | 3 |
| &#10004; | | | | 4 |
|  | &#10004; | &#10004; | &#10004; | 5 |
|  | &#10004; | | &#10004; | 6 |
|  | &#10004; | &#10004; | | 7 |
|  | &#10004; | | | 8 |
|  | | &#10004; | &#10004; | 9 |
|  | | | &#10004; | 10 |
|  | | &#10004; | | 11 |

For instance, consider Account Group A has a discount of 50% applied to shipping. There's another discount of 60% applied to shipping that is eligible to all accounts, account groups, channels and order types. In this case, Account Group A is only eligible for the discount of 50% since it is the most specific.
