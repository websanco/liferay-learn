# Product Details

The Product Details page displays important information of a product. The Product Details page can contain information such as a short description about the product, its specifications, and product images. The Product Details page may also contain links to [related products](../../product-management/creating-and-managing-products/products/related-products-up-sells-and-cross-sells.md).

The sample page highlighted below is built using the Minium Accelerator and contains the _Product Details_, _Product Publisher_, and the _Product Comparison Bar_ widgets.

The *Product Comparison Bar* widget becomes active only when you select one or more products.

In the above image, the _Product Publisher_ widget is configured to display similar items that have the same Categories and Tags. Store administrators can change the contents of this widget to display other types of related products. For more information, see the [Related Products, Upsells, and Cross-Sells](../../product-management/creating-and-managing-products/products/related-products-up-sells-and-cross-sells.md) article.
